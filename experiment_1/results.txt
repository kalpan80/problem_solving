1. TrainerAgent: Train the initial machine learning model with default or baseline hyperparameters.
2. SyntheticDataGenerator: Generate synthetic test data that is different from the original training dataset for model testing.
3. ValidatorAgent: Use the generated synthetic test data to invoke the model inference and evaluate the model's performance, obtaining the test accuracy.

I will assign these tasks and start the first iteration of the process.
Model Training Invoked  0.7 42 30
{"input":"Train initial model with baseline hyperparameters."}
{"input":"Generate synthetic test data different from training data for model validation."}
The initial model has been trained with the baseline hyperparameters: split=0.7, random_state=42, and n_estimators=30. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 92%. If you would like, I can proceed with hyperparameter tuning to try to improve the model's performance. Would you like me to do that?

The model inference results show perfect performance on the provided test data with an accuracy of 1.00. All classes (0, 1, and 2) achieved precision, recall, and f1-score of 1.00, indicating that the model predicted all test samples correctly.
Summary of Iteration 1:
- The initial model was trained with baseline hyperparameters and achieved approximately 92% accuracy on training.
- Synthetic test data was generated that was different from the training dataset.
- Model validation on the synthetic test data achieved an accuracy of 100%, perfectly classifying all samples.

Since the model has already achieved 100% accuracy on the test data in the very first iteration, further hyperparameter tuning for improvement is not necessary.

I will continue iterations for thoroughness, adjusting hyperparameters slightly to verify robustness.

2. TrainerAgent: Train model with adjusted hyperparameters (e.g., increased n_estimators and changed random_state).
3. SyntheticDataGenerator: Generate new synthetic test data distinct from the previous ones.
4. ValidatorAgent: Validate the model on the new synthetic test data and report accuracy.
