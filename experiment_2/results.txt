Episode: 9, Steps : 212, 'Exploration': 1, 'Exploitation': 211
Explanation :  Epsilon was decayed successfully to encourage more exploitation and fewer explorations. Since the episode 9 showed successful termination with 212 steps but other episodes were truncated at 500 steps, the epsilon decay rate is increased slightly to hasten the decay of epsilon, aiming for even more exploitation and potentially fewer steps. Gamma remains the same to retain the future reward discounting behavior. This should expedite convergence and reduce the steps needed in future episodes.
Episode: 12, Steps : 275, 'Exploration': 4, 'Exploitation': 271
Episode: 14, Steps : 380, 'Exploration': 3, 'Exploitation': 377
Episode: 20, Steps : 462, 'Exploration': 1, 'Exploitation': 461
Explanation :  The training history shows that episodes have recently terminated successfully with epsilon stabilized at 0.008 and epsilon_decay at 0.9995. To encourage slightly more exploitation and potentially faster convergence, I propose to slightly reduce epsilon to 0.007 while keeping gamma and epsilon_decay constant. This should maintain stable learning dynamics while potentially reducing steps further to complete episodes quicker.
Episode: 25, Steps : 452, 'Exploration': 4, 'Exploitation': 448
Episode: 30, Steps : 309, 'Exploration': 1, 'Exploitation': 308
Explanation :  The training history shows that episodes where epsilon was maintained low around 0.007 with a decay of 0.9995 led to episodes terminating earlier (fewer steps per episode). To further promote exploitation and reduce exploration stalling the agent's progress, I slightly decreased epsilon to 0.006 and increased epsilon_decay to 0.9996 to make epsilon reduce even slower over episodes, balancing exploration and exploitation more finely and encouraging efficient learning. Gamma is kept the same as it is high (0.99) which is beneficial for valuing future rewards.
Episode: 34, Steps : 383, 'Exploration': 1, 'Exploitation': 382
Episode: 36, Steps : 341, 'Exploration': 1, 'Exploitation': 340
Explanation :  The training history shows steady improvement with epsilon values decreasing slowly and a consistent gamma of 0.99. Since the agent is showing signs of learning and episodes are starting to terminate successfully with fewer steps, slightly reducing epsilon further and increasing epsilon_decay will likely encourage more exploitation with some exploration, helping the agent to converge faster and reduce steps further.
Episode: 43, Steps : 21, 'Exploration': 0, 'Exploitation': 21
Explanation :  The training history shows epsilon gradually decreasing with epsilon_decay around 0.9995-0.9997, and the steps to complete episodes significantly reduced when epsilon is low (~0.005). To further optimize, I propose slightly lowering epsilon to 0.0045 to encourage more exploitation while increasing epsilon_decay to 0.9998 to slow down exploration reduction, allowing for more stable learning over episodes. Gamma is kept at 0.99 as it is standard for considering future rewards and has not shown need for change. This should help reduce steps taken to complete episodes more reliably without causing premature convergence or excessive exploration.
Episode: 51, Steps : 327, 'Exploration': 1, 'Exploitation': 326
Episode: 53, Steps : 321, 'Exploration': 0, 'Exploitation': 321
Episode: 59, Steps : 120, 'Exploration': 1, 'Exploitation': 119
Explanation :  Based on the training history, reducing epsilon gradually while slightly increasing epsilon decay rate helps balance exploration and exploitation. The episodes where training terminated successfully had epsilon around 0.0045 or lower. I propose lowering epsilon slightly to 0.004 and increasing the epsilon decay slightly to 0.99985 to encourage faster convergence and more exploitation, aiming to reduce the steps needed to complete episodes.
Episode: 65, Steps : 283, 'Exploration': 3, 'Exploitation': 280
Episode: 67, Steps : 272, 'Exploration': 0, 'Exploitation': 272
Explanation :  The training history shows a trend of gradually decreasing epsilon and increasing epsilon_decay to promote exploitation over exploration. The decay rate has been steadily increased to 0.99985 with epsilon around 0.004. To further optimize and reduce steps, I suggest lowering epsilon slightly to 0.0035 and increasing epsilon_decay to 0.9999 to encourage more stable exploitation while maintaining some minimal exploration. Gamma remains 0.99 as it is consistent and appropriate for this environment.
Episode: 71, Steps : 191, 'Exploration': 1, 'Exploitation': 190
Episode: 76, Steps : 114, 'Exploration': 0, 'Exploitation': 114
Explanation :  The training history shows a consistent epsilon reduction with a slightly slower decay used recently (0.9999). The model achieves episodes termination with fewer steps when epsilon is around 0.0035. To try and further reduce steps, I suggest lowering epsilon slightly to 0.003 to encourage more exploitation with minimal exploration. Gamma remains 0.99 as it's standard for discounted future rewards. The epsilon decay is kept at 0.9999 to allow slow but steady reduction in exploration, avoiding premature convergence while encouraging efficient learning.
Episode: 83, Steps : 255, 'Exploration': 0, 'Exploitation': 255
Episode: 86, Steps : 71, 'Exploration': 0, 'Exploitation': 71
Explanation :  The training history shows improving performance with decreasing epsilon and slightly higher epsilon decay rates leading to termination with fewer steps. To further optimize, I suggest slightly decreasing epsilon from 0.003 to 0.0028 to reduce exploration and increase exploitation more aggressively. Additionally, increase epsilon decay from 0.9999 to 0.99995 to speed up epsilon reduction. Gamma is kept at 0.99 to maintain good future reward consideration.
Episode: 98, Steps : 110, 'Exploration': 0, 'Exploitation': 110
Explanation :  The training history shows the agent has been gradually reducing epsilon (exploration rate) and increasing exploitation, which is improving the performance by reducing the number of steps to complete episodes. The recent episodes achieve termination with fewer steps, indicating learning progress. To continue this trend, epsilon is slightly lowered to 0.0025 to promote more exploitation while still allowing minimal exploration. Epsilon decay is kept high at 0.99995 to maintain stability and avoid premature convergence. Gamma is kept constant at 0.99 as it has remained effective. This should help further reduce the steps to complete episodes and optimize training efficiency.
